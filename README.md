# C++ .obj Loader
This is a basic attempt at parsing .obj files into usable data structures. It implements the parsing of obj files into a usable C++ class as well as the re-serialization of this C++ class into an obj or json format. In between these two actions, it can perform any number of translations, dilations, or rotations on the object.
